#bootstrap-responsive-utilities

The scss version of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), responsive utilities only.
These utilities allow you to show or hide elements depending on media queries.

##How to use
Just import the `_bootstrapReponsiveUtilities.scss` file into your main sass file, like so:

`@import 'bootstrapResponsiveUtilities';`


In your html you can now use classes such as `.hidden-xs` and `.visible-lg` to hide or show elements at certain screensizes.
